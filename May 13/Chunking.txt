	Chunking is a powerful memory technique that involves grouping related information into “chunks” that you can recall rather than relying on individual pieces of information. When taking on personal and professional endeavors, recalling important information more easily can help you focus on expanding your knowledge and skills. Using chunking can significantly increase short-term memory capacity, reduce stress, aid focus, and boost productivity. Read on to discover why chunking is important and how to use this memory aid. 
	Chunking works by helping your brain reduce the information load your working memory must retrieve. When you remember information in chunks, your memory essentially contains a compacted version of the material. This way, it's easier for your working memory to remember what the chunk included. This helps to organize and store more information in your memory. Benefits of chunking : Reduce stress, Learn processes and sequences more quickly, Remember tasks and lists, etc.
Examples of Chunking :
- Bank account numbers. The numbers on your checks are chunked into groups
- Credit card numbers. They're always shown in groups of four (e.g., 5555 5555 5555 5555).
- Phone numbers. A phone number sequence of 8-8-8-5-5-5-1-2-3-4 is chunked into 888-555-1234.
